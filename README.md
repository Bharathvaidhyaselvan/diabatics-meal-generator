Editorial:
Color Codes: Change color or add a custom xolor code in Tailwind.config.css.

How does this Works:
1. Gathers information from the user via input form.
2. And make it as a prompt to search in GPT3 and also use the datas and compare them with the pre-stored datas in the Recipe.csv.
3. Displays the data in the Displays section below the input section.

Other:
As the reciepe.csv has limited reciepe, it may shows "no reciepe available" while generating ( Add more reciepe if you want).
